    <h4>This recipe will warm you and your heart</h4>
    <p>We're making green lentil "gumbo" soup with the same things we put in gumbo,
         except the signature roux. This delicious soup is gluten-free, dairy-free,
          and much lower in fat, and the lentils act as the thickener.
           The best part is that it has all the gumbo flavor you love.</p>

            <li>8 ounces chicken thighs, cut into small pieces</li>
            <li>4 ounces smoked ham, diced</li>
            <li>3/4 cup sliced fresh or frozen okra</li>
            <li>1 cup green lentils, rinsed</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon Louisiana-style hot sauce</li>
            <li>1/4 cup chopped Italian parsley</li>
            <li>1/3 cup sliced green onions</li>
            <li>2 cups cooked white rice (optional)</li>
            <li>1/3 cup sliced green onions, or as needed</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <ol><strong>Steps</strong>
            <li>Add andouille to a dry soup pot and place over medium heat.
                 Cook, stirring, until sausage begins to brown, a few minutes.</li>
            <li>Add all the olive oil, unless a lot of fat was rendered from the sausage,
                 in which case adjust the amount of oil added.</li>
            <li>Add onion, green pepper, celery, and 1/4 teaspoon salt.
                 Cook, stirring, until onions turn translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add paprika, cumin, black pepper, thyme, oregano, and bay leaf.
                 Cook, stirring, for 2 minutes more.</li>
            <li>Stir in broth, raise heat to high, and bring to a simmer. 
                Reduce heat to medium low and stir in chicken, ham, and sliced okra.</li>
            <li>Cook for 10 minutes, then stir in lentils. 
                Simmer soup, stirring occasionally, until lentils are tender, about 1 hour.</li>    
            <li>Stir in Worcestershire sauce, hot sauce, parsley, and green onions, and cook for another few minutes. Season to taste with salt. 
                Serve with rice, more green onions, and a shake of cayenne.</li>
